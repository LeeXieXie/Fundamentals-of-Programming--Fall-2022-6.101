### Programming Objectives

After taking 6.101, you should be able to...

    ...design and implement small- and medium-sized Python programs in idiomatic style, including using some advanced features of the Python language.

    ...implement, test, and debug Python programs in your preferred programming environment.

    ...use programming as a tool to solve problems in other domains.

    ...use the command line to interact with your computer.

### Conceptual Objectives

After taking 6.101, you should be able to...

    ...deconstruct a large problem into smaller pieces that can be planned out, implemented, and debugged independently.

    ...reason about the behavior of small- and medium-sized Python programs without using a computer, through the use of environment diagrams and other tools.

    ...understand the tradeoffs associated with various algorithms and data structures, in terms of efficiency and correctness.

    ...predict some edge cases and failure modes when designing a program, before writing any code.


## Setting Yourself Up For Success in 6.101 and Beyond[](intro.html#_setting_yourself_up_for_success_in_6_101_and_beyond)

A common question near the start of any new semester is: what can I do to make sure that I get the most out of the subjects I'm taking this semester? In this section, we'll do our best to answer that question as it pertains to 6.101; and, given that 6.101 has a number of moving parts, we'll try to offer specific advice for maximizing the utility of each of those parts.

We believe that following this advice will not only help you do well in 6.101, but it will also help you maximize your learning over the semester and your ability to make use of the 6.101 content in the future.

### Readings

-   **Reserve Time to Read.** Find time on your schedule to do the reading before it's due. Mark it on your calendar the same way you would a lecture time.
    
-   **Read the Words**. Focus and read the words. For tricky parts that aren't clear at first, it may help to reread the paragraph, or to read it aloud. If reading on a screen is distracting, print the reading and read it on paper.
    
-   **Engage with the Questions**. Every reading has some questions embedded in it (including this one!). Think carefully about each question and try to answer it yourself first. You can try these reading questions any number of times, but if you find yourself guessing randomly or trying all possible answers, then pause, step back, and ask for help. You do not need to get all the questions correct, but random guessing is unlikely to count for reading credit.
    
-   **Try the Code**. Most readings (not this one) will include example Python code. Try it out in your own editing environment! The best way to try out a piece of code is to read it carefully first, understand and internalize how it works, and then recreate it yourself in your code editor, out of your own head, without looking at the reading. Look back at the reading only if you can't get it to work, and pay particular attention to the bits you missed. This gives you practice similar to creating the code yourself, in a way that direct copying does not. [Benjamin Franklin used this technique](https://pradeep90.github.io/ben-franklin-practice.html) to improve his writing, and it works in other disciplines too.
    

### Recitations

-   **Come to Recitation**. Since 6.101 has no lectures, recitation sections are the classroom experience for this course. It's hard to succeed without going to class, so put the section times on your calendar and make sure to come.
    
-   **Laptops Closed**. Your laptop is a great tool for programming but unfortunately also a huge opportunity for multitasking and distraction. The price of that distraction is paid not only by you but by all those around you who can see your screen. In [one study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254), multitasking led to an 11% drop in score on a subsequent test. But for people _without laptops_, merely having a laptop multitasker in their field of view led to a 17% drop in test score. That's 1.5 letter grades worse! Laptop distraction is like secondhand smoking. It hurts other people, not just you. So please keep your laptop closed and put away during recitation.
    
-   **Take Notes**. Bring paper or a notebook, and take notes! Taking notes is a great way to engage your brain, focus your attention, and help you remember afterward what you learned. When taking notes, use your own words, and try to emphasize the big ideas; then, return later to review and fill in the gaps.
    
-   **Ask Questions**. When you are confused by something, or if you think you see a bug in the instructor's code, please raise your hand and ask. Chances are that other people have the same confusion that you do. Please help make the class better by asking questions!
    

### Labs

-   **Start Early**. Read the lab handout on the day it is released, and start thinking about how you might approach each part. Reading the entire handout before starting is very important, because it gives you the big picture and goals that the different parts of the lab are moving toward. You may even find that, even if you don't start _actively_ working on a lab early in the week, reading through it right away will allow your subconscious brain to be thinking about it as you relax or work on other things during the week.
    
-   **Plan Before Coding**. Before opening your code editor, plan out how your function might work on paper or a whiteboard. Write your algorithm first as pseudocode (English that is close to code). Look for subparts of the problem that might be pulled out as helper functions and give them good names.
    
-   **Work On Your Own**. 6.101 is not about group software engineering; it is intended instead to develop your individual self-efficacy at programming. In order to maximize your own development, try to tackle the labs yourself and only ask for help on a component of a lab after you have spent some time working on it individually.
    
-   **Ask for Help When You Need It**. Of course, it's very likely that there will be times when you will encounter problems that you aren't able to tackle on your own. Spinning your wheels for too long while being stuck is not a very efficient way to learn, either. When this happens, it's a good idea to [ask for help](../info/help.html). For debugging questions, in-person help is best.
